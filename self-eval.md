# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
  * It felt amazing to use all the skills we've learned to make this work!

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
  * Pretty good I think! I don't feel over worked at all

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
  * I ended up having to do this alone. I was gone for about an hour and a half this morning, and even though my group mates said they'd wait for me to work on this, they did it without me anyway instead of working on the testing lesson instead like I thought we agreed. By the time I realized, there was no one left to work with. I'm sure it was just a miscommunication, but it still didn't feel great. I'm hoping future team interactions will be more reliable.
